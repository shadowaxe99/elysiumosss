As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate binary files or executable JAR files directly. However, I can provide you with an example of a shell script that could be used to compile Java source code and package it into a JAR file, which is typically how a JAR like `ElysiumOS.jar` would be created.

Here's an example of a shell script that could be used to compile the Java source files and package them into a JAR:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to the source directory
cd ElysiumOS/src

# Compile the Java source files
javac core/*.java automation_station/*.java arena/*.java ai/*.java user_interface/*.java utils/*.java networking/*.java database/*.java metaverse/*.java blockchain/*.java localization/*.java accessibility/*.java plugins/*.java recovery/*.java hardware/*.java cloud/*.java

# Create the JAR file
jar cvfm ../build/ElysiumOS.jar ../src/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF core/*.class automation_station/*.class arena/*.class ai/*.class user_interface/*.class utils/*.class networking/*.class database/*.class metaverse/*.class blockchain/*.class localization/*.class accessibility/*.class plugins/*.class recovery/*.class hardware/*.class cloud/*.class

# Clean up the class files
find . -type f -name "*.class" -delete

# Return to the original directory
cd ../..
```

This script assumes that there is a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file in the `src` directory that specifies the main class and any other necessary manifest information. The `jar` command packages the compiled `.class` files into a JAR file, and the `find` command cleans up the `.class` files after the JAR is created.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of your project and the specific requirements of your build process.
