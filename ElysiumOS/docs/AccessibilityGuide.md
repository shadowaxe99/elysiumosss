## Introduction
Elysium OS is committed to creating an inclusive environment for all users. This guide outlines the accessibility features and options available within the platform to ensure that everyone, regardless of ability, can have a seamless and enjoyable experience.

## Features

### High Contrast Themes
Users can enable high contrast themes to improve readability and reduce eye strain. These themes can be activated through the `settingsToggle` in the `MainUI`.

```css
/* In ui/css/themes.css */
.high-contrast {
  background-color: #000;
  color: #FFF;
  border-color: #FFF;
}
```

### Voice Commands
The Butler/Consigliere AI agent recognizes and executes voice commands, allowing users with limited mobility to navigate and interact with the platform hands-free.

```java
// In src/ai/AIAssistant.java
public void processVoiceCommand(String command) {
  // Code to process and execute voice command
}
```

### Screen Reader Support
Elysium OS supports screen readers, providing audio descriptions for all on-screen elements and actions. This feature can be toggled in the `accessibilitySwitch` located in the `SettingsPanel`.

```javascript
// In ui/js/accessibility.js
function enableScreenReaderSupport() {
  // Code to enhance screen reader compatibility
}
```

### Keyboard Navigation
All features in Elysium OS are accessible via keyboard shortcuts, ensuring that users who cannot use a mouse can still navigate the platform efficiently.

```javascript
// In ui/js/app.js
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  // Code to handle keyboard navigation
});
```

For multimedia content, Elysium OS provides subtitles and closed captions. This can be enabled in the `userPreferences` settings.

```javascript
// In ui/js/media.js
function enableSubtitles() {
  // Code to display subtitles on videos
}
```

Users can adjust the font size across the platform to suit their visual preferences. This option is available in the `userPreferences` menu.

function adjustFontSize(size) {
  // Code to change font size
}
```
