# Elysium OS Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Elysium OS Developer Documentation. This guide is intended for developers who are contributing to the Elysium OS project. It provides an overview of the system architecture, setup instructions, coding standards, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- Git
- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Docker
- Kubernetes (for deployment)

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElysiumOS/ElysiumOS.git
cd ElysiumOS
```

## System Architecture

Elysium OS is built using a microservices architecture, with the following main components:

- **Front-End Interface** (`/ui`): Built with React.js, Redux, and GraphQL.
- **AI Agents** (`/src/ai`): Includes modules like `NaturalLanguageProcessor.java` and `AIAssistant.java`.
- **Backend Services** (`/src/core`, `/src/networking`, `/src/database`): Node.js and Express.js applications handling business logic.
- **Blockchain Integration** (`/src/blockchain`): Ethereum smart contracts and integration services.

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the MongoDB and Redis servers:

```bash
mongod
redis-server
```

3. Run the backend services:

```bash
npm run start-backend
```

4. Run the front-end development server:

```bash
npm run start-ui
```

## Coding Standards

- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Ensure all code is well-documented using JSDoc for JavaScript and JavaDoc for Java.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.
- Maintain the shared dependencies and naming conventions as outlined in the project's shared dependencies document.

## Contributing

To contribute to Elysium OS, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and write unit tests to ensure your code works as expected.

3. Run the existing test suite to ensure no regressions:

```bash
npm run test
```

4. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:

```bash
git commit -am "Add a new feature"
```

5. Push your branch to the repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

6. Open a pull request against the `main` branch for review.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests for all new code in the `/tests/unit` directory.
- Integration tests should be placed in the `/tests/integration` directory.
- Perform manual testing in a local environment before submitting a pull request.

## Documentation

- Update the `README.md` file with any new build and configuration instructions.
- Document new code modules in the `APIReference.md`.
- Update the `SystemArchitecture.md` if there are any changes to the system design.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the support team via the project's issue tracker.
